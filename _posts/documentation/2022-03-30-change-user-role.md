You might have accidentally pressed the wrong user role when you first signed up to memlock. You can change it after you've logged in.

### Changing your user role

1. Click the profile icon in the top right corner of the screen. It looks like ðŸ‘¤.

2. On the profile screen, you should see a box titled "Who you are". Click the Change button to the right.

3. Select the correct role. You may need to accept the terms and conditions again.
