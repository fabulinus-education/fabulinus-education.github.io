## About you

We anticipate that the users of our application are either;
 * Student users, no less than 13 years old, who are enrolled in an educational institution, which throughout this policy we refer to as "school".
 * Individuals working on behalf of a school.

## What data do we collect?

We collect the following data:

 * Personal identification information (Your name and email address).
 * The class and school you study at or work for.
 * The syllabus you are following and your progress through it.
 * Your role, for example if you are a student or teacher.
 * Data about any responses you give in the app or website, in particular to questions provided to you by the app. For example, that you answered a particular question on a particular day.
 * Usage information about the app or website. For example, how often you used the app.

## How do we collect your data?

You will provide us with most of the data we collect. We collect and process data when you:

 * Register online.
 * You sign into the app.
 * You answer any questions in the app.
 * You contact us for support.

We offer a website version of the app which is equivalent in functionality. You data is treated in the same way when you visit our website.

We may also receive your data indirectly when identifying information is provided to us by:
 * Your school or employer for the purposes of providing you access to our service and associating you with a particular class.

## How will we use your data?

We will use your data differently depending on if you are a teacher or a student. We will rely on information provided by you or your school to determine if you are a teacher or a student.

For all users, we will collect your data so that we can:
 * Manage your account.
 * Understand how you are using the app and to use this information to make the app or its content more intuitive.
 * If you use third party sign-in services from Google or Microsoft, we will retain minimal information required for us to operate these services.

If we **have not** been provided your data by your school, when you link your account to a school we will share the data you have provided to us with your school or employer so they can:
 * Identify you.
 * Provide you with a licence to use the product.

By providing us with a link code and confirming your acceptance, you are giving us permission to provide your data with the school.

If we **have** been provided your data by your school, we will share any updates to your profile with them automatically.

### Students

**If you are a student**, our company will collect your data so we can:
 * Provide you with a personalised spaced repetition revision plan.
 * Provided you opt-in, email or provide you with other reminders (for example, notifications) to complete your personalised spaced repetition plan.
 * Show staff members nominated by your school detailed information about your answers and how you are using the app so they can assess your performance.
 * Collect data which is not linked to you about responses to content so we can:
     * Identify improvements to that content, for example where more content is required, or it is too difficult.
     * To help us market the product or engage in educational research, publish or use information which contains data about how students answer questions in a way which cannot be linked to individual students or institutions. This data will only ever be published at an aggregate level.
